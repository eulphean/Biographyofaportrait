# Biography of a Portrait
During COVID-19 lockdown in Chicago, Amay Kataria was commissioned by Chicago based visual artist [Jennifer Traina-Dorge](https://jennifertrainadorge.com/) to create [biographyofaportrait.art](https://biographyofaportrait.art). It's a story we tell ourselves about who we are and where we belong, not necessarily based in reality. This project combines online and desktop signifiers to navigate a conceptual triptych—“Today”, “Tomorrow”, and “Yesterday”—ideally viewed on a mobile device. 

This project is created using open-source libraries like [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
